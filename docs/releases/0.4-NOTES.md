# Performance improvements
We successfully resolved the negative impact of pod level anti-affinity symmetry on the normal pods. For normal pods with no pod level anti-affinity symmetry conflict, we see very substantial benefits as we observed in the earlier throughput performance testing exercise we did (20-30X better).
With the latest design changes, irrespective of size of the "Jobs" (Replicaset, Deployment or Jobs), we are seeing substantial throughput benefits using Firmament scheduler as long as resource requirements (CPU/Mem) for incoming Pods are uniform. This is mainly because Firmament is able to efficiently amortize work across ReplicaSets/Deployments/Jobs.
